    <p class="text--large">OpenRA is an <a href="https://github.com/openRA">open source project</a> that recreates and modernizes classic real time strategy games, like <strong>Red Alert</strong>, <strong>Command & Conquer</strong>, and <strong>Dune 2000</strong>.</p>

      We’ve developed a flexible game engine (<a href="https://github.com/openRA/openRA">the OpenRA engine</a>) that provides a common platform for rebuilding and reimagining classic 2D and 2.5D RTS games. The OpenRA engine is not restricted by the technical limitations of the original games. It includes <strong>native support for modern operating systems</strong> (like Windows 10, OSX, and Linux), screen resolutions without relying on emulation or hacks, and <a href="/games">integrated online multiplayer</a>.

    <h2 class="site-section__heading">Modernizing Classic RTS Games</h2>
    <p>While we love the classic RTS gameplay, multiplayer game design has evolved significantly since the 1990s. The OpenRA engine includes <strong>new features and gameplay improvements</strong> of the modern era:</p>
    <ul class="u-two-column">
      <li>A choice between <strong>“right click”</strong> and classic <strong>“left click”</strong> control schemes</li>
      <li>Overhauled sidebar interfaces with support for <strong>hotkeys and production queues</strong></li>
      <li>Improved unit controls with features such as <strong>Attack-Move and stances</strong></li>
      <li>The <strong>“fog of war”</strong> that obscures the battlefield outside your units' line of sight</li>
      <li>Other modern RTS features such as capturable <strong>tech structures and unit veterancy</strong></li>
      <li>Support for <strong>game replays and an observer interface</strong> designed for streaming games online</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These core changes and continuous balance refinements to support the active multiplayer community mean that the OpenRA gameplay has evolved from the classic releases, with heavy influences from later C&C titles.</p>
    <p><strong>OpenRA is 100% free</strong>, and comes bundled with three distinct mods. When you run a mod for the first time the game can automatically download the original game assets, or you can use the original game disks. </p>

    <p>Games developed for the OpenRA engine are known as “mods”. These mods plug in to the OpenRA engine and extend it with new scripts and assets to make distinct experiences. Many classic Westwood games have already been officially released as mods for OpenRA:</p>

	Title: OpenRA 1v1 Multiplayer Ladder Update
	Author: milkman
	Content: The community-led OpenRA 1v1 Ladder ranking system has recently seen its first major upgrade since almost two years. Most notably, the stale all-time ranking system has been archived and the shorter, more dynamic 2-months rankings have taken center stage. The Ladder currently supports the Red Alert and Tiberian Dawn mods with dedicated game servers that contribute outcomes to the ranking algorithms. Check out https://oraladder.net for current leaderboards, latest game results, and instructions on how to join the competition.

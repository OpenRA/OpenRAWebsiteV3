    <p class="text--large">OpenRA is an <a href="https://github.com/OpenRA">open source project</a> that recreates and modernizes classic real time strategy games, like <strong>Red Alert</strong>, <strong>Command & Conquer</strong>, and <strong>Dune 2000</strong>.</p>

      <p>We’ve developed a flexible game engine (<a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA">the OpenRA engine</a>) that provides a common platform for rebuilding and reimagining classic 2D and 2.5D RTS games. The OpenRA engine is not restricted by the technical limitations of the original games. It includes <strong>native support for modern operating systems</strong> (like Windows 10, macOS, and Linux) and screen resolutions without relying on emulation or hacks, and <a href="{{ '/games/' | relative_url }}">integrated online multiplayer</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="site-section__heading">Modernizing Classic RTS Games</h2>
    <p>While we love the classic RTS gameplay, multiplayer game design has evolved significantly since the 1990s. The OpenRA engine includes <strong>new features and gameplay improvements</strong> that are standard in more recent RTS games:</p>
    <ul class="u-two-column">
      <li>A choice between <strong>“right click”</strong> and classic <strong>“left click”</strong> control schemes</li>
      <li>Overhauled sidebar interfaces with support for <strong>hotkeys and production queues</strong></li>
      <li>Improved unit controls with features such as <strong>Attack-Move and stances</strong></li>
      <li>The <strong>“fog of war”</strong> that obscures the battlefield outside your units' line of sight</li>
      <li>Other modern RTS features such as capturable <strong>tech structures and unit veterancy</strong></li>
      <li>Support for <strong>game replays and an observer interface</strong> designed for streaming games online</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These core changes and continuous balance refinements to support the active multiplayer community mean that the OpenRA gameplay has evolved from the classic releases, with heavy influences from later C&C titles.</p>
    <p><strong>OpenRA is 100% free</strong>, and comes bundled with three distinct mods. When you run a mod for the first time the game can automatically download the original game assets, or you can use the original game disks. </p>

    <p>Games built using the OpenRA engine are known as <strong>“mods”</strong>. The OpenRA development team maintain the three official mods that can be downloaded from this website, but many more are developed and maintained by the OpenRA community.</p>

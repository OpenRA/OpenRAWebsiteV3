No battle plan survives first contact, and the same goes for software updates. We’re rolling out a hotfix to address a few issues identified in the latest release. Here’s what’s been fixed:

- **Harvesters now mine smarter;** They’ll stick closer to their refinery instead of wandering off
- **Rally points display correctly;** Unit move commands are now consistently shown
- **Jungle trees won’t crash the game as they burn;** Some Tiberian Dawn trees were feeling spicy
- **OpenRA again runs on Raspberry Pi;** Shader compilers be crazy
- **Lobby alignments fixed;** In multiplayer skirmish lobbies, team numbers are now properly centered
- **Adjusted Dune 2000 weapon splash damage;** To better match the vanilla balance
- **Fixed green gliches on Dune 2000 corpses;** Soldiers were spilling green blood

#### A Look Back at OpenRA Release 20250303

The 20250303 release was one of OpenRA’s biggest updates yet, bringing over a year of development and community playtesting into a polished final version. If you missed it, here’s a quick refresher on the major additions:

We significantly improved support for high-definition art assets, especially for the Tiberian Dawn HD project. This brings:
* Faster load times
* Better performance
* Fewer graphical bugs

Tiberian Dawn HD is packaged as a separate release and can be [downloaded here](https://github.com/OpenRA/TiberianDawnHD/releases/tag/release-20250330). This preview is multiplayer-compatible with the main 20250330 release.

To use it, the C&C Remastered Collection must be installed via Steam or the EA App. If you’re on macOS or Linux, follow the project README for [detailed installation instructions](https://github.com/OpenRA/TiberianDawnHD#asset-installation).

#### Dune 2000 Visual Overhaul

The original Dune 2000 shipped with an option for 16-bit sprites, but OpenRA had previously only supported lower-quality 8-bit versions. Thanks to HD graphics improvements, the game has now been fully upgraded to higher quality assets, bringing:
* Smoother shading and reduced color banding
* More detailed terrain, units, explosions, and sidebar icons

With a newly active Dune 2000 modding community, additional missing assets and refinements have been introduced:
* Missing versions of 16-bit assets
* Added vehicle husks
* More varied explosion debris and husk effects
* Refined Spice Bloom animations for more predictable growth
* Proper Saboteur logic

We completely revamped the Map Editor with a modern and intuitive design. It now includes:
* Draggable selections and actors for easier editing
* Measurement tools and a marker layer to fine-tune maps
* A play button for quick testing
* Many other quality-of-life improvements

The Tiberian Dawn mod now includes a built-in encyclopedia, providing a central resource for unit, structure, and technology details. This addition was inspired by the community’s request for an in-game knowledge base, consolidating information that was previously scattered across wikis (many of which are now outdated).

New Missions & Gameplay Enhancements
* Two new Red Alert missions were added, alongside various mission improvements
* Skirmish options now persist between matches instead of resetting
* Balance changes for Red Alert and Dune 2000 for a more refined experience

Under-the-Hood Improvements
* Added support for The Ultimate Collection (Steam version)
* Improved installation support for classic assets from the C&C Remastered Collection
* Significant progress toward future language support

Our Halloween 2014 release is now available, and is overflowing with both tricks and treats!<br />
This release includes over 760 commits by 41 contributors since our [July release]({{ '/news/release-20140722/' | relative_url }}).

The most visible change in this release is the redesigned in-game UI:

- The RA mod has received a brand new sidebar.
- Improved [keyboard shortcut](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Hotkeys) configuration, with new defaults based on Tiberium Wars and Red Alert 3.
- The in-game menu has been completely overhauled, and now includes information on mission objectives.
- A new end-game score screen appears once a game is complete.

The other big focus of this release was a complete overhaul of our [map scripting](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Map-scripting) support for creating single-player missions and multi-player minigames.  Our [new Lua API](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Lua-API) is faster, more robust, and provides many new features that were not available in the older API (which has now been removed).

A large number of smaller features have also been included.  A small selection from our [full changelog](https://wiki.openra.net/Changelog/b39a8c21fd8551b7bd80b8fc9ec3ed615a395af6) includes:

- The lobby now prevents players from choosing "cheating" colors that are too similar to the terrain.
- Veteran units gain improved reload time and accuracy, and elite units will now heal over time.
- Planes will maintain their distance from each other in a similar fashion to helicopters.
- Servers will now drop players with unresponsive connections to unfreeze stalled games.
- Units will now properly move inside transports, instead of teleporting.
- Tank turrets will now turn to face forward after the unit has finished attacking.
- A number of small balance changes to the Red Alert and Tiberian Dawn mods.
- Many more small bug-fixes and behaviour improvements.

  <figcaption>Game servers will detect when a player causes extended periods of lag, and disconnect them from the game. This should resolve the situations where a multiplayer game would freeze after a player drops.</figcaption>

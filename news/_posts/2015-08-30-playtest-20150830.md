Another playtest on the road to our next stable release is ready!

Being in a feature freeze, we focused on fixing bugs and inconsistencies reported by community members to ensure the release is as bug-free as possible.

More notable things that got fixed include:

* An exploit where spies in RA could infiltrate team mate's structures.
* Issues with crushing infantry and walls.
* Issues with units entering transports.
* Visual errors connected to shroud and fog of war.

For details check out the [full changelog](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/819ed63d2caa8e7fbc3ec4bf972fee5fd19ae2f3).

This playtest removes a couple of features that were not ready for prime-time, including the threaded renderer performance optimization on Windows.  We found that this feature mysteriously interferes with the ability to restore minimized windows from the task bar, but don't understand why! If you are a programmer with experience in multi-threaded OpenGL and SDL on Windows, please get in touch and help us debug this.

See the [full changelog](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/122c13bd912f00d4e0c75dc6cbb0e0efd4e424d3) for all of the changes in this playtest, and head on over to our [download page]({{ '/download' | relative_url }}) to try it out!  We hope that this will be the last playtest before the next OpenRA release, so please report any other issues you know of via [our forum](https://forum.openra.net), our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues), or in the comments below.

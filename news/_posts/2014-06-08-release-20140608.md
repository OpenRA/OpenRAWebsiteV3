We are pleased to announce the June release of OpenRA. This is another huge milestone, with 52 authors contributing a total of 1582 commits since our [holiday release]({{ '/news/release-20131223/' | relative_url }}).

Seeing is believing, and so we have worked with [SoScared](https://www.youtube.com/user/SoScared101) (who produced our awesome [gameplay trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueosN-JFqG0)) to create a video preview of this new release:

For the textually inclined, a brief summary of our key changes are:

- Significant UI improvements for selecting mods, the game lobby, replays, and spectating.
- Dramatic load-time improvements.
- Beacons for signaling team-mates and observers, and viewing the status of support powers.
- Aircraft and helicopters can now attack-move, guard, and be guarded by ground units.
- Vehicle husks can now be destroyed or captured.
- The RA mod now includes the Phase transport and a new Soviet Hijacker infantry.
- The D2K mod now includes concrete, the Grenadier, and a collection of graphical improvements.
- The TD mod received a collection of balance improvements, and several new maps.
- Our Tiberian Sun mod saw significant development, but will not be ready for several more months.

The full list of important changes are available [on our wiki](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog).
We have also improved our website and build server, which are now "in the cloud".
Our new [openra.net](http://openra.net) domain is served from [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and our installer packages are created using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/OpenRA/OpenRA/).
These changes should significantly improve the website responsiveness and download speeds.

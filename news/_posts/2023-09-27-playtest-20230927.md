<hr />

As summer is in full swing, we are excited to kick off the playtest series for the upcoming OpenRA release! This time around, it is all about spring cleaning: squashing bugs, implementing minor requested features, and preparing for larger reworks. But fear not! We still have a bunch of cool stuff lined up just for you! Without further ado, here are some notable changes you can expect in [Playtest 20230801]({{ '/download' | relative_url }}):

* Added new Covert Ops missions for Tiberian Dawn: "Eviction Notice" and "Twist of Fate"
* Added new Red Alert missions "Allies10b" and "Soviet13a" and the Counter-Strike mission "Mousetrap"
* Fixed several palette remapping issues and restored the ability to select darker player colors
* Implemented a new custom Lua wrapper which improves error reporting for map scripters
* Introduced a modular asset installer which allows for installation of the classic assets via Steam or the EA app
* Reworked sprite sequences, significantly improving third party modding support

And before we wrap up, we would like mention that this release contains significant progress towards C&C Remastered Collection support, including compatibility with the new EA app. The "Tiberian Dawn HD" playtest is a separate release and can be [downloaded here](https://github.com/OpenRA/TiberianDawnHD/releases/tag/playtest-20230801). This preview is multiplayer-compatible with the main 20230801 playtest. However, please keep in mind that performance, memory usage and loading times have not been optimized yet. The C&C Remastered Collection must be installed through Steam or the EA App, and in case you are using macOS or Linux the project README provides you [detailed installation instructions](https://github.com/OpenRA/TiberianDawnHD#asset-installation).

Stay tuned for more updates and be sure to take part in the playtest. Don't forget to share your feedback with us on [our forum](https://forum.openra.net/), [community Discord server](https://discord.openra.net), or [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues). Enjoy the summer gaming season with OpenRA!

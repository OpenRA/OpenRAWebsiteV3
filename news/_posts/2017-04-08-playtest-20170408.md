You probably have already guessed the bad news, the buyable hats from [our April Fools post]({{ '/news/april-20170401/' | relative_url }}) are not going to be in the next OpenRA release. Don't be too sad however, as this ought to be the final playtest before the next release! So be sure to [grab yourself an installer]({{ '/download' | relative_url }}) and use this last chance to report bugs and give us feedback.

As we're trying to make our release (candidates) as stable as possible, this playtest doesn't include many big changes compared to the last playtest. However, the Tiberian Dawn map pool got an extensive overhaul, with over 50 maps being added! Other minor touch-ups, like the changes to the Red Alert map pool or the last minute balance fine tweaks are listed in the [complete changelog](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/5d16339b25ad3fe88f293f4590cb959f70000a5b).

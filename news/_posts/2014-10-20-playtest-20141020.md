Hot on the heels of last week's [playtest-20141012]({{ '/news/playtest-20141012/' | relative_url }}), we have just released a [third and (hopefully) final playtest]({{ '/download' | relative_url }}) in preparation for our stable Halloween release next weekend.

Development over the last week has been focused on tidying up loose ends, and includes:

- An overhauled observer/replay sidebar for the Red Alert mod.
- An improved (and hopefully more robust) crash-detection mechanism.
- Improved memory usage over the previous playtests.
- Further improvements to our new Lua API, and the removal of the old API.
- Further improvements to our packaged single-player missions.
- Additional minor polish improvements and bug fixes.

Please take this playtest out for a spin and report any and all problems on [our bug tracker](https://bugs.openra.net)!

The [original playtest-20221203 announcement]({{ '/news/playtest-20221203/' | relative_url }}) is included below:

<hr/>

Welcome back, Commanders! After more than a year and a half the OpenRA team proudly presents [Playtest 20221203]({{ '/download' | relative_url }}). It is finally here!

There have been tons of massive changes under the hood, and with reduced contributor activity it took us a very long time to catch and squash all those pesky bugs. With the help of our third party mods and people testing the devtest builds we believe we have finally got a stable release on our hands. We are incredibly excited to showcase a number of new features and improvements that have been built up over the last year and a half:

* One highlight feature is the new hierarchical pathfinder, which massively increases performance on large or more complex maps.

* Our new netcode brings major improvements to multiplayer. Your games should feel much smoother and units more responsive in both low and high latency settings.

* We have added transient text notifications matching speech notifications. Now you can play without sound!

* The fairly recent Dune film has brought many players to Dune 2000 and a decently sized multiplayer community was born. With the feedback from the community Dune 2000 has received a number of balance and polish changes.

* Tiberian Sun was not forgotten either. Although still not ready for a release, it has also received its fair share of features and bug fixes. This time around the highlight is tilting on slopes.

**Note: The 1110 playtest contained issues under Windows and Debian/Ubuntu.**<br />
**These have been resolved in the 1112 build.**

We have just released a new playtest build containing the latest snapshot of our development progress.
Playtest-20131112 can be downloaded from the [download page]({{ '/download' | relative_url }}) or using your git client.
If you run into any issues or have any feedback then you can create a ticket on our [Github issue tracker](https://bugs.openra.net) or find us on IRC.

Some of the key changes from our [stable september release]({{ '/news/release-20130915/' | relative_url }}) include:

   - Added support for multiple languages (translations for DE, FR, ES, RU and PL are in progress).
   - Added support for password-protected servers and a global lobby chat channel.
   - Additional UI polishing, including a new settings menu, overhauled chat, and improved hotkey support.
   - Improvements to RA include production acceleration, the base radius from C&C, and the M.A.D Tank!
   - An overhauled Airstrike and improved weapon effects for C&C (now renamed to Tiberian Dawn).
   - The popular RA map Haos Ridges is now available in Tiberian Dawn.

As usual, the [changelog](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/playtest-20131112/CHANGELOG) contains all the details, including a list of changes that affect maps and mods.

Our friends at [Project Perfect Mod](https://www.ppmsite.com/) have created a new [OpenRA Editing Forums](https://www.ppmsite.com/forum/index.php?f=929) section where modders can compare notes with each other.
We will be keeping an eye on these as well as our [official forum](https://forum.openra.net/) (which is currently offline due to a hardware failure).

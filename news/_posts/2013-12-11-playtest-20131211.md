**Update: We have now released a fourth playtest (20131220) which fixes a few additional issues.**

This is the second release candidate playtest after several days of intensive testing and fixing regressions. Our [stable release milestone](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues?labels=&milestone=4&page=1&state=open) indicates the remaining blockers which is a countdown to zero based on community input. Thanks to everyone who helped testing and reported bugs!

The new features in this build which require special attention to the testing volunteers:

   - Added support for Command & Conquer: Tiberian Dawn and Dune 2000 shroud rendering.
   - Improved the way cliffs, smudges and player color remaps in the d2k mod are rendered.

Checkout the [news section]({{ '/news/' | relative_url }}) on our website to get an idea what the previous playtests introduced. As usual, the [changelog](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/playtest-20131211/CHANGELOG) contains all the details, including a list of changes that affect maps and mods.

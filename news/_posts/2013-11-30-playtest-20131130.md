The headline feature of this new playtest is the addition of [Lua scripting](https://www.lua.org/about.html) for maps, which allows anybody to create scripted missions or game modes without touching any C# engine code.
Any maps added to [our content site](https://resource.openra.net) will be downloaded when joining a server, which makes it easy to share your creations with others.

We have made the tough decision to delay the previously announced IRC and translation features into a later release.
This will allow us to focus our efforts on getting the next release out within the next couple of weeks.

The main improvements over our [stable september release]({{ '/news/release-20130915/' | relative_url }}) are now:

   - Added support for Lua scripting in maps.
   - Added remakes of the first two Allied missions to RA (using our new scripting system).
   - Additional UI polishing, including a new settings menu, overhauled chat, and improved hotkey support.
   - Additional ingame polish, including new infantry animations, move-flashes, and improved to pixel-doubling.
   - Added options for always displaying health bars, and alternative DOTA-style bar colors.
   - Improvements to RA include production acceleration, the base radius from C&C, and the M.A.D Tank!
   - C&C (now renamed to Tiberian Dawn) receives a new Airstrike, new sound and weapon effects, and a remake of the popular Haos Ridges map.

As usual, the [changelog](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/playtest-20131130/CHANGELOG) contains all the details, including a list of changes that affect maps and mods.
If you run into any issues or have any feedback then you can create a ticket on our [Github issue tracker](https://bugs.openra.net) or find us on IRC.

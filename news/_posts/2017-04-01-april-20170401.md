## New ColorPicker

Our color picker has often been criticized for blocking too many colors and not giving much to select from. Fortunately our fellow comrade '[pulse](https://forum.openra.net/viewtopic.php?p=294293#p294293)' took a look at it.

  <figcaption>The old color picker was just not intuitive enough and has been replaced by this non-restrictive, user friendly gem.</figcaption>

## Brexit news: Britain also leaves the Allies

No worries! We plan to readd them later as own faction ("RTG", the "Real Tough Guys"). They'll be joined by other Commonwealth members/oceanian nations like Australia and Atlantis.

The United States of America will fill in the empty spot in the Allies' rows. They got +200% build speed increase on concrete walls and also have access to Kennels and Guard Dogs. Instead of Tanya they'll get their own hero unit: Donald J. Trump himself! His special abilities are: the best. Just believe us, he has the best and most tremendous abilities.

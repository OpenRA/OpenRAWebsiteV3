Today we have a special occasion on our hands. We have been waiting for this moment for almost two years: A new stable OpenRA [Release 20230225]({{ '/download' | relative_url }}) is out now!

A lot of features have built up over the two years. This release is packed to the brim with goodies small and large. Several major systems have been added and overhauled, a great deal of rougher edges smoothed out. For details see the previous playtest news posts [[one]({{ '/news/playtest-20221203/' | relative_url }}), [two]({{ '/news/playtest-20221223/' | relative_url }}), [three]({{ '/news/playtest-20230110/' | relative_url }}), [four]({{ '/news/playtest-20230218/' | relative_url }})] and, as always, for a full overview - [the full changelog](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/dc394e2f3532e7fe830118716ebdbaaa4e945eaf).

But wait, there's more! This release brings major behind-the-scenes changes towards supporting the C&C Remastered Collection assets. This support is still incomplete, but works well enough that we are today also releasing a development preview of "Tiberian Dawn HD". It is a separate release and can be [downloaded here](https://github.com/OpenRA/TiberianDawnHD/releases/tag/release-20230225). This preview is multiplayer-compatible with the main 20230225 release, but performance, memory usage, and loading times have not been optimized, and do not reflect the expected final requirements. The C&C Remastered Collection must be installed through Steam or Origin, and the project README provides [installation instructions for macOS and Linux](https://github.com/OpenRA/TiberianDawnHD#asset-installation).

In case you were wondering wether we ran out of treats, worry not! Modders will also be feasting sweet this time. There were major updates to [our documentation](https://docs.openra.net/en/release), and our tooling was joined by the [OpenRA (Mini)YAML Language Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=openra.oraide-vscode) and the [OpenRA Lua API extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=openra.vscode-openra-lua).

It has been a long road to this release, so we hope youâ€™ll enjoy this newest installment of OpenRA! Good luck on the battlefield commanders, and have fun!

This brings the public release up to date with development changes from August 2023 through to January 2025. Three months of public playtesting have allowed us to polish these changes into the release today.

Notable changes include a newly revamped Map Editor, a switch to high-quality Dune 2000 assets, a Tiberian Dawn encyclopedia, new missions and all around usability and performance improvements. For details see the previous playtest news posts [[one]({{ '/news/playtest-20241116/' | relative_url }}), [two]({{ '/news/playtest-20241228/' | relative_url }}), [three]({{ '/news/playtest-20250220/' | relative_url }})] and, as always, for a full overview - [the full changelog](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/f58d25d621dded0b935383fb410ca9bbb23ce6a7).

This latest release has significantly improved support for HD art assets. You should notice faster load times and overall performance improvements for the "Tiberian Dawn HD" project. It is packaged as a separate release and can be [downloaded here](https://github.com/OpenRA/TiberianDawnHD/releases/tag/release-20250303). This preview is multiplayer-compatible with the main 20250303 Release. The C&C Remastered Collection must be installed through Steam or the EA App, and if using macOS or Linux, the project README provides [detailed installation instructions](https://github.com/OpenRA/TiberianDawnHD#asset-installation).

Don't forget to share your feedback with us on [our forum](https://forum.openra.net/), [community Discord server](https://discord.openra.net), or [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues). We hope you'll enjoy this newest installment of OpenRA! Good luck on the battlefield, Commanders!

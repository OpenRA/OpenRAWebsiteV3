We have just released a new playtest which enhances [our September release]({{ '/news/release-20130915/' | relative_url }}) with the foundations
for the next great release. The playtest-20131019-5 build is available from the [download page]({{ '/download' | relative_url }}).

These playtest builds provide a snapshot of our current development for feedback by our testers. You can help shape the
future of OpenRA by testing these builds and [reporting bugs](https://bugs.openra.net) or simply letting us know what you think.

The main changes in this development build are:

   - Added support for password protected servers.
   - Added a global chat channel to the server lobby. This will be extended game-wide in a future playtest.
   - Added support for multiple languages. Translations for DE and FR are in progress for a future playtest.
   - Testing reworked balance for RA, including the base-radius limit from C&C.
   - Fixed several bugs that were discovered in release-20130915.

See the [changelog](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/playtest-20131019/CHANGELOG) for more details on the playtest changes.

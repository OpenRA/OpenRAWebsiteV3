Attention, all map designers and modders! 

It is your time now to show everything you've got at the coming Map Design Contest! Between grinding and thoroughly testing competitive 1v1 maps, unleashing artistry and entertainment in casual maps and implementing highly intricate scripting in modded maps, you will have pretty much anything that is possible to be inserted into a map file to be put up for a competition!

Well respected representatives of community are induced into the map judging jury that will decide the best of the best submissions in the contest among the categories. Forum attendants are also encouraged to participate in selecting the most popular map of the competition through the Popular Vote which will be held after map submission period is over.

The contest starts on July 7th; you will have just more than a month to submit your works for it. Be sure to check all the rules and time regulations at [OpenRA's new forums](https://forum.openra.net/viewtopic.php?f=83&t=20573).

Don't hold on your creativity, and may the best map win!

Another weekend, another playtest! To help a small number of players who are experiencing problems with poor GPU drivers, we are today releasing [playtest-20200426]({{ '/download' | relative_url }}) which restores the ability to use OpenGL 2.1.

OpenRA will continue to prefer OpenGL 3.2+ (or OpenGL ES 3.0+), but a new option in the settings menu allows you to switch back to the legacy rendering API if you experience glitches or performance issues.

This playtest also includes a scripting fix for two RA campaign missions, but no other gameplay changes. We believe that all of the important issues have now been resolved, so plan a final release in the near future if no issues are reported with the updated graphics support.

<hr />

With the recent [hotfix release]({{ '/news/release-20200202/' | relative_url }}) addressing the worst bugs on the stable branch, we have been able to focus on completing work for the next big release.
We have taken a step back from gameplay this time around, focusing instead on core engine logic and improved UI features.

[Playtest 20200303]({{ '/download' | relative_url }}) is now available, with a overhauled renderer that adds several long-awaited features:

* <span class="about-highlight">Smooth Zooming:</span> The previous "pixel doubling" feature has been updated with the ability to smoothly zoom the battlefield using the mouse wheel or new hotkeys (<span class="about-highlight">[</span> and <span class="about-highlight">]</span>). The default zoom level can be changed using the new Battlefield Camera option in the settings menu.
* <span class="about-highlight">UI size options:</span> Players with larger screen resolutions can increase the size of the menus, sidebar, and other UI elements using the new UI Scale option in the settings menu.
* <span class="about-highlight">Improved HiDPI support:</span> OpenRA can now detect HiDPI rendering modes on Windows and Linux, fixing the blurry rendering for players on Windows with higher resolution screens. Many UI elements now include high resolution artwork, staying crisp when drawn at larger sizes.
* <span class="about-highlight">New introduction screen:</span> A new screen is displayed when launching the game for the first time to introduce the most important display and control options.
* <span class="about-highlight">Overhauled settings menu:</span> The Display and Input settings panels have been refreshed with new options and a new layout.

We note that <span class="about-highlight">OpenGL 3.2 or OpenGL ES 3 are now required</span>. Moving away from OpenGL 2 is important for future compatibility with modern rendering APIs (Vulkan/Metal). This does unfortunately mean dropping support for some older systems (typically 10+ years old) that currently can run OpenRA, but we believe that this is a necessary tradeoff for the future.

Other notable changes in playtest-20200303 include:

* <span class="about-highlight">Updated production rallypoints:</span> Rally points can now be queued (<span class="about-highlight">Shift + Click</span>) to define more complicated paths, and are now hidden until explicitly set.
* <span class="about-highlight">New hotkeys:</span> Shortcuts have been added to select and cycle harvesters (<span class="about-highlight">N</span>) and the production structure associated with the sidebar (<span class="about-highlight">Tab</span>).
* <span class="about-highlight">New spectator Army tab:</span> A new spectator view provides another way to compare player strength.
* <span class="about-highlight">Notarized macOS releases:</span> OpenRA is no longer blocked by the Gatekeeper on recent macOS versions.
* <span class="about-highlight">Improved pathfinding logic:</span> Units are now smarter about moving when their original path is blocked.
* <span class="about-highlight">Map editor improvements:</span> Undo/Redo is now supported, and improvements have been made to Copy/Paste and the actor property editor.

The playtest also includes a collection of modder-focused changes, and marks further progress towards the work-in-progress Tiberian Sun mod with fixes for low-level rendering bugs and new logic for production exits, EMP vs Aircraft, and the Firestorm Generator.
